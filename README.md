# require-all
Requires and times all modules in a project

Usage:

To add to a project:
```
yarn add project-repl
npx make-repl
```

To run the repl:
```
./repl
```

Or if you didn't do `npx make-repl`, you can just do
```
npx repl
```

This will require all your dependencies and .js files and tell you 
how long they took to require.
